          In my current role as an <b>Operational Officer</b> at
          <b>Princess Alexandra Hospital- Group Linen Services</b> since May
          2022, I excel in delivering comprehensive linen services.<br />
          My expertise includes machine-assisted folding and ironing, meticulous
          hand-folding of linen, and expert packaging of cleaned linen. <br />
          Prior to this, from January 2015 to May 2022, I served as a
          <b>Chiller Assessor</b> and <b>MSA Beef Grader</b> at
          <b>Australian Country Choice</b>.<br />
          In this role, I conducted detailed evaluations of beef carcasses
          following MSA guidelines. This involved assessing various attributes
          such as marbling, meat color, fat cover, and ossification.<br />
          I actively collaborated with a dedicated team to ensure precise and
          consistent grading in line with MSA standards. My contributions
          extended beyond evaluation; I provided valuable feedback to producers
          and suppliers, enhancing beef quality and achieving superior grading
          results.<br />
          Managing precise grading records and collaborating with different
          departments for data analysis were integral aspects of my
          responsibilities.<br />
          Through my efforts, I significantly contributed to maintaining product
          excellence and ensuring customer satisfaction by implementing
          effective grading protocols.<br />
          I am passionate about delivering exceptional quality in every task I
          undertake, and I am committed to continuous improvement and excellence
          in all aspects of my work.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            Hello! I'm Ezekiel Moureen Milne, a passionate and aspiring web
            developer currently enrolled in the Web Development Bootcamp at
            Coder Academy in Brisbane. With a strong dedication to mastering the
            art of web development, I am on a mission to create seamless and
            visually appealing online experiences.

          <h2>Personal Background</h2>

          <p>
            Iâ€™m a proud Cebuano, born and raised amidst the lively streets of
            Cebu in the Philippines. My journey took a turn when I was 18, and
            alongside my incredible mom and brother, we embarked on a new
            adventure in the beautiful land of Australia, which swiftly became
            our home sweet home.

            <p>In this heartwarming tale of mine, love took center stage when I met
            my beautiful wife. Together, weâ€™re navigating the rollercoaster of
            parenthood, thanks to our energetic 4-year-old son, who brings
            boundless joy and purpose to my life. Every day, he reminds me of
            the strength that resides within and the limitless love a family can
            offer.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>

          <p>
            My educational journey has been quite the ride, full of twists,
            turns, and exciting discoveries. Right now, I'm diving headfirst
            into the world of Information Technology at Coder Academy Brisbane.
            It's a whirlwind of coding, creativity, and endless possibilities,
            and I'm loving every moment of it. 
            But that's not all! I'm also juggling part-time studies for a
            Diploma in Information Technology, exploring the depths of this
            fascinating field and uncovering its secrets one class at a time.</p>
       

            <p>Before my tech adventures, I explored the world of meat industry
            certifications back in 2016, earning my stripes in AUS-Meat Chiller
            Assessment, MSA Grading, and Ph Decline and Measurement (Beef).
            Plus, I've got a Certificate III in Aged Care from 2014, where I
            learned the true meaning of compassion and care. </p>

            <p>Oh, and let's not forget my roots! My educational journey began in
            the Philippines, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in
            Physiotherapy from 2010 to 2013. Those were the years that shaped my
            discipline, determination, and love for learning.

            With every certificate earned and every class attended, I'm not just
            accumulating knowledge; I'm crafting my own story. Each lesson
            learned adds a new brushstroke to the colorful canvas of my life,
            and I can't wait to see what the next chapter holds. Here's to the
            thrill of learning and the adventures yet to come! ðŸš€âœ¨</p>
         
        </div>

        <div class="passions_and_interests">
          <h2>Passions and Interests</h2>

          <p>
            In the tapestry of my life, you'll find me passionately pursuing a
            variety of interests that add vibrant hues to my everyday
            experiences. First and foremost, there's nothing quite like the
            adrenaline rush of playing basketball; the sound of sneakers
            squeaking on the court and the thrill of a perfect shot never fail
            to energize me. Badminton, with its fast-paced rallies and strategic
            gameplay, is another sport that I find immense joy in. </p>

            <p>When I'm not on the court, you can often find me at the gym, where I
            channel my energy into rigorous workouts. The feeling of pushing my
            limits and striving for personal bests is not just a physical
            endeavor but a mental and emotional one too, shaping my resilience
            and determination.</p> 

            <p>On a different note, I find solace in the world of anime. The
            captivating stories, vibrant characters, and imaginative worlds
            transport me to realms where creativity knows no bounds. Whether
            it's following the adventures of my favorite characters or exploring
            new anime series, this passion is a delightful escape into the realm
            of imagination. </p>

            <p>These interests, each unique in its own way, weave together the
            fabric of my identity, making me who I am. They bring balance, joy,
            and a sense of fulfillment to my life, reminding me of the
            importance of pursuing what truly sets my soul on fire.</p>

        <div class="goals_and_aspirations">
          <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>

          <p>
            In this journey called life, I've set my sights on some exciting
            goals that keep me moving forward with a heart full of ambition.
            Right now, my short-term dream is to dive deep into the world of
            development. I'm passionate about coding and creating, and my goal
            is to become a skilled developer. Why? Well, it's not just about the
            code; it's about the freedom it offers. I want to work remotely,
            crafting amazing digital experiences, all while cherishing precious
            moments with my son. He's my world, and being there for him as he
            grows up means everything to me. </p>

            <p>Looking further down the road, my long-term aspirations are big,
            bold, and beautifully challenging. I dream of building a real estate
            portfolio, investing in properties that will not only be wise
            financial decisions but also homes and spaces where people can
            thrive. Having my own business is another dream close to my heart. I
            want to create something from scratch, nurture it, and watch it
            flourish â€“ a venture that reflects my passion and dedication. </p>

            <p>But there's more to it than just financial success. My ultimate goal
            is to achieve financial freedom. I want to break free from
            limitations, to live life on my terms, and to empower others along
            the way. It's not just about the numbers; it's about the sense of
            security and the freedom to chase even bigger dreams. </p>

            <p>So, here's to dreaming big, working hard, and embracing the
            challenges that come my way. With determination in my heart and a
            clear vision in my mind, I'm on a mission to turn these aspirations
            into my reality. Let's see where this adventure takes us! ðŸš€ðŸ’«</p>

            <h2>Personal Background</h2>

            <p>Iâ€™m a proud Cebuano, born and raised amidst the lively streets of Cebu in the Philippines. My journey took a turn when I was 18, and alongside my incredible mom and brother, we embarked on a new adventure in the beautiful land of Australia, which swiftly became our home sweet home.<br>

            In this heartwarming tale of mine, love took center stage when I met my beautiful wife. Together, weâ€™re navigating the rollercoaster of parenthood, thanks to our energetic 4-year-old son, who brings boundless joy and purpose to my life. Every day, he reminds me of the strength that resides within and the limitless love a family can offer.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>

            <p>My educational journey has been quite the ride, full of twists, turns, and exciting discoveries. Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the world of Information Technology at Coder Academy Brisbane. It's a whirlwind of coding, creativity, and endless possibilities, and I'm loving every moment of it. <br>

                But that's not all! I'm also juggling part-time studies for a Diploma in Information Technology, exploring the depths of this fascinating field and uncovering its secrets one class at a time. <br>
                
                Before my tech adventures, I explored the world of meat industry certifications back in 2016, earning my stripes in AUS-Meat Chiller Assessment, MSA Grading, and Ph Decline and Measurement (Beef). Plus, I've got a Certificate III in Aged Care from 2014, where I learned the true meaning of compassion and care. <br>
                
                Oh, and let's not forget my roots! My educational journey began in the Philippines, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Physiotherapy from 2010 to 2013. Those were the years that shaped my discipline, determination, and love for learning. <br>
                
                With every certificate earned and every class attended, I'm not just accumulating knowledge; I'm crafting my own story. Each lesson learned adds a new brushstroke to the colorful canvas of my life, and I can't wait to see what the next chapter holds. Here's to the thrill of learning and the adventures yet to come! ðŸš€âœ¨</p>
